# riso-windowseat

Procedural risograph films and prints, each a single `index.html` of Canvas 2D and Web Audio:
no libraries, fonts, images or network calls. The repo began as the release of **Window Seat**.
Making it, and the two shorts before it, produced a reusable kit of Claude Code skills, craft
docs and a render harness. Roost and Held were made with it next.

## Films

All are 1080 × 1080, 30 fps. MP4s are on the
[v1.0 release](https://github.com/sevenevesai/riso-windowseat/releases/tag/v1.0). To watch the
source instead, open any `index.html` in a browser and press play.

| Film | Length | |
|---|---|---|
| [Window Seat](films/window-seat/) | 78 s | A night train journey through one window, scored for piano |
| [Roost](films/roost/) | 70 s | One take of a starling murmuration from sunset to roost, scored for strings |
| [Held](films/held/) | 70 s | A kite that flies only while something holds its line, scored for found instruments |
| [Lumen](films/lumen/) | 28 s | A seed that contains a sun; the first short, in call-and-response form |
| [Emergence](films/emergence/) | 28 s | Lumen's sibling: how machines learned to listen, as nine worlds |

### Window Seat

A night train journey seen through one fixed window with a glass of water on the sill. Every
pixel and every sound except the piano is procedural.

| Time | Passage |
|---|---|
| 0–19 s | Golden departure from a platform, fields, a red truss bridge, a conifer cutting, a tunnel |
| 19–38 s | A night city with a canal and a level crossing; another train overtakes, passengers in its windows |
| 38–57 s | Fireworks over a lake, sleeper hours with star trails, pre-dawn fog |
| 57–78 s | Dawn from a viaduct, rain streaming back along the glass, a lakeside halt under a rainbow |

The score, "A Light Left in the Window", is an original piano piece in 6/8 whose phrasing follows
the picture's timeline. The glass of water leans with every acceleration and is the last thing to
settle.

### Roost

A murmuration over a marsh in one fixed view. Each starling is a 2–3 px ink dot, so the flock
is the halftone: where the sheet turns edge-on, the birds pile into dark printed ribbons. A
falcon stoops through it and the flock pours into the reeds at nightfall. The string score is
timed from the picture.

### Held

A paper kite's line frays and parts at a hillside stake. Loose, it can only tumble; it falls
across a harbour town, is snagged for a moment by a church weathervane, and over the water its
line catches on a sloop's forestay, so the kite climbs again, held by the boat sailing into
dusk. Its tail and loose line are simulated ropes. The score uses CC0 mbira, harp, glockenspiel,
chimes, strings and flute, with every cue read from the picture's events.

## How they're made

I directed each film; Claude Code (Anthropic's coding agent) wrote the code, using the skills,
rules and docs in this repo. A work is designed in its `FILM.md`, its hardest frame is proved
first, and then it is inspected as frame strips, 1:1 crops and loudness sheets rendered by
`tools/`. Every frame is a pure function of time (`seek(t)`), so any moment can be inspected
exactly and the MP4 cannot drop frames. Each `FILM.md` records the design decisions and
measurements, and lists the film's remaining weaknesses.

## Make your own

```
git clone https://github.com/sevenevesai/riso-windowseat
cd riso-windowseat/tools
npm install && npm run setup && npm test
```

Then open Claude Code in the repo root and ask, for example:

- "Make a 40 second riso film of a lighthouse keeper's night."
- "Make a riso poster of a heron on a pier at dusk."
- "Score this film" or "The rain at 66 s is too loud."
- "Extend Window Seat with a snowy mountain pass after the lake."

`CLAUDE.md` gives the session the contract and commands. The `riso-film`, `riso-still` and
`riso-score` skills in `.claude/skills/` carry the workflow and gates. Each skill's `examples.md`
points to the routines in the shipped films that are worth reusing. A hook warns when an edit
breaks determinism.

## What's inside

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `films/` | The five films, each with its `FILM.md`; Window Seat, Roost and Held include sample credits and bank rebuild scripts |
| `prints/workings/` | A still print series and the print kit new works start from |
| `docs/` | The craft: brief, visual development, drawing, scene space, motion, sound, quality bar |
| `studies/` | Interactive A/B studies of each technique, and the sound kit |
| `tools/` | Scaffolding, verification, contact sheets, audio analysis and MP4 export ([README](tools/README.md)) |
| `.claude/` | Skills, the ink-plate rule and the determinism hook |
